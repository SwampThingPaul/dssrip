DSS-Rip
=======
The DSS-R (i)nterface (p)roject

R functions to read/write data from HEC-DSS files.  This may become a more formal R package, when I have time.

At the moment, the loading of the package, or installing from github using devtools, does not work.  The best way to use this "package" is to download and 'source' the dssrt.r file to load the functions.
